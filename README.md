## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
• Instagram - sending reels to friends, messaging is fun with background changes
• Kindle - reading books on my phone and able to send books to Kindle device with ease
• Outlook - able to have my email fast from personal and school accounts, able to have a dark mode 


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I would get stuck on which button to select as Xcode has so much tools to use, I would mess up and lose my focus since I clicked on the wrong thing
